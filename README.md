## GAN  Network
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of deep learning model consisting of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator generates new data samples, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of these samples. Through adversarial training, the generator learns to produce realistic data that can fool the discriminator.

## Introduction
The GAN Neural Network project explores the implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic data, particularly focusing on the generation of fashion images. GANs have gained significant attention in the field of deep learning for their ability to generate realistic data samples that closely resemble the training data distribution.

In this project, we leverage the power of GANs to generate fashion images resembling those found in the Fashion MNIST dataset. By training a GAN model on the Fashion MNIST dataset, we aim to create a generator that can produce high-quality fashion images indistinguishable from real ones.

## Dataset Used
The Fashion MNIST dataset is utilized as the training data for the GAN model. Fashion MNIST is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items belonging to 10 categories, with each image being a 28x28 pixel. The dataset serves as an ideal benchmark for training generative models due to its simplicity and accessibility.

## Steps to Build the FashionGAN Model
### Step 1: Import Dependencies and Data
Import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow Datasets.
Load the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow Datasets.
### Step 2: Visualize Data and Build Dataset
Visualize sample images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Preprocess the data and build the input pipeline for training.
### Step 3: Define Generator and Discriminator
#### Generator
The generator takes random noise as input and generates fake fashion images.
It consists of several layers of convolutional and upsampling operations to transform the input noise into realistic images.
#### Discriminator
The discriminator is a binary classifier that distinguishes between real fashion images and fake images generated by the generator.
It consists of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers to classify the input images as real or fake.
### Step 4: Build Neural Network
Import TensorFlow Keras components for building the generator and discriminator.
Define the architecture of the generator and discriminator models using TensorFlow Keras layers.
### Step 5: Construct Training Loop
We set up the training loop for the GAN model, including defining loss functions, optimizers, and implementing the training process. The training loop alternates between training the generator and discriminator to optimize their respective objectives.
